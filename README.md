# Leveraging-GPS-Data-for-Machine-Learning
Location data is an important category of data that you frequently have to deal with in many machine learning applications. Location data typically provides a lot of extra context to your application’s data.This repo talks about how to process data and pre-process GPS information for ML-DL pipelines

## Geospatial data formats

There are a number of standard formats. They store geometry data along with other descriptive attributes about geographical entities. For instance, they could store route coordinates for roads along with the road surface, width, speed limit, type (city street, highway, etc).

Some of the most commonly used formats are:

    Shapefile (oldest and most widely used standard. A single ‘shapefile’ actually consists of a set of files — one file stores geometry data, another file stores custom data attributes, etc)
    GeoPackage (newer spec that is gaining popularity. Captures data in a single lightweight SQLLite database file with multiple layers)
    GeoJSON (uses standard text-based JSON format)
